This project has been modeled using the agentpy library. It uses a grid environment and has three types of agents: cars, roads and stoplights. As of now, it works using two agents and two roads, but this behaviour can be modified.

Features
* Multiple car agent traverse road agents marked as untravelled
* Roads can be marked as travelled and untravelled
* Stoplights control de behaviour of specific car agent
